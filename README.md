Background:
A driver-adjustable shock absorber as per journey demands.

Implementation:
- A stepper motor-based damper control system, efficient enough of adjusting shocks position to absorb shocks
- User Interface on OLED display for Drivers and key controls using switches

Findings:
Electronic Damper Control System (EDCS) Motors replace the factory-fitted damper adjustment knobs on each coilover unit, giving fast and independent adjustment.
